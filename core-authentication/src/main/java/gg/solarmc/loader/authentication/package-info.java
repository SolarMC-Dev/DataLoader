/**
 * Everything related to authenticating users, premium and cracked, through
 * their accounts on SolarMC. <br>
 * <br>
 * For the sake of consistency, "authenticating" refers to the process of logging in
 * to a SolarMC account. The "login protocol" refers to the protocol of encryption
 * request and response employed by premium clients. An "autologin" refers to an
 * attempt to detect a premium user and authenticate them automatically without
 * any effort by the user to enter a password. Documentation often refers to "joining
 * <b>a</b> proxy" because it is entirely possible for multiple proxies to be in
 * concurrent operation and have users joining them simultaneously. <br>
 * <br>
 * While players are not permitted to play, they are placed in a limbo server in
 * which they have nothing to do but log in when prompted for a password. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Login Process</b> <br>
 * First, it must be determined whether the user is premium or cracked. This is done by
 * searching for an existing user with the same name. <br>
 * <br>
 * If an existing user is found, the joining user is assumed to be that user. If the existing user
 * is premium, the joining user is verified via the login protocol as premium. If in this case
 * the joining user is actually cracked, they are unfortunately kicked with "Invald session".
 * If the joining user is indeed premium, the user is permitted to play. <br>
 * <br>
 * If the existing user is cracked and NOT "desiring migration", the joining user must enter the
 * password of the existing user. If the joining user is unsuccessful, they are kicked. If they
 * are successful, and their account is cracked, they are permitted to play normally. It is not
 * possible to know whether the joining user, upon successful login is actually premium, without
 * a lookup to the Mojang API. The user is treated as cracked regardless. <br>
 * <br>
 * If the existing user is cracked and marked as "desiring migration", the user is first verified
 * via the login protocol as premium, as if they were an existing premium user. Then, they must also
 * enter the password of the existing cracked user. Once this is successful, the user's data is
 * migrated to their new, premium UUID. This migration occurs only for our premier data stored with
 * dataloader; it cannot be helped to migrate third party plugin data. <br>
 * <br>
 * If there is no existing user, then a lookup to the Mojang API will be performed to best judge
 * whether the user is premium or cracked. If there is a premium user according to the Mojang API
 * with the username, then the joining user is assumed to be that premium user, and they must
 * complete the login protocol. If the user is actually cracked but they were detected as premium,
 * they are kicked with "invalid session." If the user is indeed premium, they are verified using
 * the premium login protocol. Then, there are two possible outcomes. Either a cracked account has
 * been created in the intervening time in which the login protocol was completed (a very small
 * window of time), or not. If that happens, the premium user must enter the account password.
 * Upon successful password entry, the user's data is migrated to the new premium UUID, following
 * the same migration process  as if a premium user logged in to the account of an existing cracked
 * user desiring migration. <br>
 * <br>
 * The "Invalid Session" kick message is not changeable. This is the only user-facing weakness
 * of the system, which occurs when a player is best thought to be premium, but in actuality
 * is a cracked user. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Case Sensitivity of Names</b> <br>
 * It cannot be permitted to have multiple cracked users with the same name ignoring case.
 * Cracked users who have the same name ignoring case but a different name including case
 * will have different UUIDs. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Desiring Migration</b> <br>
 * Marking accounts as desiring migration is the means for cracked users to migrate to premium accounts.
 * The cracked user must mark their account as desiring migration. Then, they must login as a premium user.
